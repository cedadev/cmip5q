    <p class="red"> There are two sets of forms on this page, one for internal coupling, and one for external
    couplings. Please modify these one at a time:
        <ul><li>If you make changes to both sets of forms, only those
        changes made to the one you save survive ...
        <li> You can make multiple changes within one set of forms.
        <li>Each time you save a form with a new entry, a new blank entry form will appear for a new entry.
