<h1> General Introduction </h1>
<p class="cmip5q"> Clearly much more has to be written here </p>
<h4> Basic Concepts </h4>
<ol>
<li> Each CMIP5 modelling centre is running <em> Simulations </em> which run <em> Models </em> on <em> Platforms </em>.</li>
<li>The <em> Models </em> are made up of <em>Components</em></li>
<li>The top level components under models can be <em> coupled </em> to other components, or to files. 
Coupling to other components are termed <em> internal couplings</em>, those which are intended to be coupled to files are termed <em> external couplings</em>. We resolve internal couplings when we describe models. We resolve external couplings as part of <em> boundary condition </em> descriptions when describing <em> simulations </em>.</li>
<li> When describing simulations we also have to clearly explain how the simulation has met the 
<em> numerical requirements </em> of the <em> experiment </em> with which it is associated. This is done via the <em> conformance </em> page, which maps the requirements onto initial and boundary conditions (and if necessary <em> code modifications </em>).

<h4> Typical Path Through the Questionnaire </h4>

<p> We expect most folk will begin by describing a model. You will need to describe the model in enough
detail to a) validate the model using the validate button (which will tell you which sections remain
incomplete), and b) have enough inputs described to be able to answer conformance questions in the simulations (most of 
these are about how the model met various boundary conditions, so you will need the input requirements for those
boundary conditions to be described. However, validation is not necessary before beginning to fill out a simulation
(although a platform description is necessary), and one can go through an iterative process of trying to fill out
the experiment conformances and going back to the model to describe inputs, then filling out boundary conditions
(either as defaults in the model, or in the  simulation descriptions, or both).</p>

<p> As indicated above, you will need a platform description before filling out a simulation, but that wont
be hard ... </p>

<p> Simulation descriptions are mainly about describing the initial and  boundary conditions along with how
the simulation conformed to the numerical experiment. You will probably have to dive off and create some
initial conditions, and if you are creating an ensemble, you'll need to describe the ensemble members.</p>

<p> We have the concept of code modifications for physical ensemble members, and also for code modifications
to a basic state model needed to conform to a numerical experiment. You can create and assign those from
either the ensemble interface or the conformance interface. </p>

<p> Throughout you may need to add references, and make links between components or simulations, and those references. </p>


<h1> Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
<ol>
<li> <p>Why don't you ask about the outputs from components?</p>
<p> Because we tie the outputs to the "realms" (the top level components under
the models) using the realm attribute in your NetCDF output files. </p>
