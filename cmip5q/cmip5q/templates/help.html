<h1> General Introduction </h1>
<p class="cmip5q"> Clearly much more has to be written here </p>
<h4> Mailing List </h4>
<p>We have set up a <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/cmip5qhelp" target="_blank">mailing list </a> to provide support for users entering information into the questionnaire</p>
<h4> Basic Concepts </h4>
<ol>
<li> Each CMIP5 modelling centre is performing <em> Simulations </em> which run <em> Models </em> on 
    <em> Platforms</em>.</li>
<li>The <em> Models </em> are made up of <em>Components</em>.</li>
<li><em>Simulations </em> <em>Conform</em> to the <em>Numerical Requirements</em> of <em> Experiments</em>. </li>
<li><em>Conformances </em> consist of either specific code modifications or the use of specific boundary 
    or initial condition <em>Files</em>.</li>
<li>The top level components under models (also known as <em>Realms</em>) can be <em> Coupled </em> 
    either to other components, or to files. 
    <ul>
        <li><em>Internal Couplings</em> describe couplings to other components.</li>
	    <li><em>External Couplings</em> describe couplings to files.</li>
    </ul>
</li>		
</ol>

<h4> Purpose </h4>
<p>The purpose of this questionnaire is to glean information about... 
<ul>
<li>Models, Components and Platforms,</li>
<li>Simulations, Experiments and Numerical Requirements,</li>
<li>Conformances, Files and Coupling,</li>
</ul>
and/or their relationships.




<h4> Typical Path Through the Questionnaire </h4>

<p> We expect most folk will begin by describing a model. You will need to describe the model in enough
detail to a) validate the model using the validate button (which will tell you which sections remain
incomplete), and b) have enough inputs described to be able to answer conformance questions in the simulations (most of 
these are about how the model met various boundary conditions, so you will need the input requirements for those
boundary conditions to be described. However, validation is not necessary before beginning to fill out a simulation
(although a platform description is necessary), and one can go through an iterative process of trying to fill out
the experiment conformances and going back to the model to describe inputs, then filling out boundary conditions
(either as defaults in the model, or in the  simulation descriptions, or both).</p>

<p> As indicated above, you will need a platform description before filling out a simulation, but that wont
be hard ... </p>

<p>When describing simulations you will be asked to clearly explain how the simulation has met the 
numerical requirements of the experiment with which it is associated.
This is done via the conformance  page, which maps the numerical requirements onto initial and 
boundary conditions (and, if necessary, onto code modifications) .  
You will probably have to dive off and create some initial conditions. </p>

<p> If you are creating an ensemble, you'll need to describe the ensemble members.  We have the concept of 
code modifications for physical ensemble members, and also for code modifications
to a basic state model needed to conform to a numerical experiment. You can create and assign those from
either the ensemble interface or the conformance interface. </p>

<p> Throughout you may need to add references, and make links between components or simulations, and those references. </p>

<h1> Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
<ol>
<li> <p>Why don't you ask about the outputs from components?</p>
<p> Because we tie the outputs to the "realms" (the top level components under
the models) using the realm attribute in your NetCDF output files. </p>
</li>
</ol>
